# Final Project: Analyzing Key Determinants of Property Prices in New York


## Project Summary
This project analyzes NYC property prices to understand key factors influencing real estate values. We explore:

1) Key Price Determinants: Examining the impact of location, property size, and amenities on pricing.
2) Market Segmentation: Identifying property clusters using machine learning techniques.
3) Borough-Wise Trends: Comparing property values across different NYC boroughs.
4) Geospatial Analysis: Visualizing property price distribution using mapping techniques.
5) Predictive Modeling: Using regression models to estimate property prices based on key features.

## Required Packages
